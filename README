Do you want me to drag my sack across your face?

Feedbag is a feed auto-discovery Ruby library.

Synopsis
--------
 ~/axiombox/feedbag :master $ irb
 >> require "feedbag"
 => true
 >> f = Feedbag.find "http://log.damog.net/"
 => ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/TeoremaDelCerdoInfinito", "http://log.damog.net/comments/feed/"]
 >> 

Why you should use it?
----------------------
- Because it's cool.
- Because it only uses Hpricot as dependency.
- Because it follows modern feed filename conventions.
- Because it's a single file.

Why did you build it?
---------------------
- Because I liked Benjamin Trott's Feed::Finder.
- Because I thought it would be good to have Feed::Finder's functionality
  in Ruby.
- Because I thought it was going to be easy to maintain.
- Because I was going to use it on rFeed.
