Commando is not only a great action film but also a showcase of Arnold Schwarzenegger's charisma and talent. He plays John Matrix, a former commando who lives a peaceful life with his daughter Jenny (Alyssa Milano) in a secluded cabin. However, his past catches up with him when a former colleague informs him that his former team members have been killed by a mysterious enemy.
 
Soon, Matrix learns that the enemy is Bennett (Vernon Wells), a former commando who was presumed dead but is actually working for Arius (Dan Hedaya), a deposed dictator who wants to regain power in his country. Arius kidnaps Jenny and forces Matrix to assassinate the current president of his country. Matrix agrees to do the job but secretly plans to escape and rescue his daughter.
 
With the help of Cindy (Rae Dawn Chong), a flight attendant who becomes his ally, Matrix tracks down Arius and Bennett to their island fortress. There, he faces an army of mercenaries and engages in a brutal fight with Bennett. Will he be able to save his daughter and stop Arius' evil plan?
